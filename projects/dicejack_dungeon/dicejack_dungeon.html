    <h1>Dicejack Dungeon</h1>
    <p>Dicejack Dungeons is a roguelike dungeon crawler mixed with the card game Blackjack. Players traverse through a randomly generated dungeon trying to reach the exit.</p>
    <p>However instead of the traditional method of combat players must duel their enemies in rounds of a modified Blackjack.</p>

    <p><strong>Combat Rules:</strong></p>
    <p>Both player and enemy must try and reduce their opponents health bar to zero. If the enemy kills the player it is game over</p>
    <p>however if the player kills the enemy they will be rewarded with gold, items and crafting materials before moving to the next room</p>
    <p>over 12. Each turn the Player will be given the choice to either roll or pass. Once either both opponents have passed or one goes over</p>
    <p>12 the winner will deal damage to their opponent based on how much they won by.If either opponent manages to score a perfect 12 they</p>
    <p>will perform a critical strike dealing double damage. If both opponents tie nothing happens.</p>
    <p><strong>Exploration Rules:</strong></p>
    <p>While you traverse the dungeon you will encounter many rooms e.g. monster room, chest room, shop room, trap room, crafting room.</p>
