    <h1>Blackjack Dice</h1>
    <p>A small game I made in python inspired by the card game blackjack. You can choose to play singleplayer against a bot, local multiplayer with someone else or simulation were to bots play each other.</p>
    <p> I used the <strong>colorama</strong> libary to add color to the game along with the build in <strong>random</strong> and <strong>os</strong> libaries.</p>

    <p><strong>Rules:</strong></p> 
    <p>1. Both players start with a deck of 10 cards with random values ranging from 1 - 10.</p>
    <p>2. Both players take turns drawing cards trying to get as close to 21.</p>
    <p>3. Although if you go over 21 you automatically lose and the other player wins.</p>
    <p>4. However if both players pass and neither go over 21 whoever has the highest number wins.</p>
